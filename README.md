# ExpensesCalc

A customized expenses calculator since Excel isn't for me. It'll start off pretty basic, but I plan on building it into a fully functioning application. 

User Input:
    > CMD args...

CMD(s):
    - exp (add expenses)
    - add (add revenue)
    - del (remove expenses or revenue)
    - list (list all expenses, revenue, and total balance)
    - eval (evaluate expenses)
    - exit (exit the application)

Format:
    - exp Label 0.00
    - add Label 0.00
    - del Label 0.00
