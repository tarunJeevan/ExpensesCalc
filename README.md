# ExpensesCalc

A customized expenses calculator since Excel isn't for me. It'll start off pretty basic, but I plan on building it into a fully functioning application. 

**User Input:**
- CMD \[args...\]

**CMD(s):**
- exp (add expenses)
- add (add revenue)
- del (remove expenses or revenue)
- list (list all expenses and revenue)
- eval (evaluate expenses and list balance)
- clear (clear the opened expense sheet)
- exit (exit the application)

**Todo:**
- Add time stamps to entries
- Add auto-fill to UI
- Add auto-saving OR Warning to save before user closes application

**Log:**
- Added desired basic functionality (06/21/2023)
- Added basic serialization (06/23/2023)
- Created release build with basic serialization (06/24/2023)
